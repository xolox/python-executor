# TODO Expose a clean way to interrupt the fudge factor of other processes.
# TODO Properly document command timeout / lock-timeout / TERM-timeout / KILL-timeout.
# TODO See if there's a way to move command timeout support out of the CLI?
# TODO Find ways to improve the coverage of this module! (multiprocessing?)

Usage: executor [OPTIONS] COMMAND ...

Easy subprocess management on the command line based on the Python package with
the same name. The `executor' program runs external commands with support for
timeouts, dynamic startup delay (fudge factor) and exclusive locking.

You can think of `executor' as a combination of the `flock' and `timelimit'
programs with some additional niceties (namely the dynamic startup delay and
integrated system logging on UNIX platforms).

Supported options:

  -t, --timeout=LIMIT

    Set the time after which the given command will be aborted. By default
    LIMIT is counted in seconds. You can also use one of the suffixes `s'
    (seconds), `m' (minutes), `h' (hours) or `d' (days).

  -f, --fudge-factor=LIMIT

    This option controls the dynamic startup delay (fudge factor) which is
    useful when you want a periodic task to run once per given interval but the
    exact time is not important. Refer to the --timeout option for acceptable
    values of LIMIT, this number specifies the maximum amount of time to sleep
    before running the command (the minimum is zero, otherwise you could just
    include the command `sleep N && ...' in your command line :-).

  -e, --exclusive

    Use an interprocess lock file to guarantee that executor will never run
    the external command concurrently. Refer to the --lock-timeout option
    to customize blocking / non-blocking behavior. To customize the name
    of the lock file you can use the --lock-file option.

  -T, --lock-timeout=LIMIT

    By default executor tries to claim the lock and if it fails it will exit
    with a nonzero exit code. This option can be used to enable blocking
    behavior. Refer to the --timeout option for acceptable values of LIMIT.

  -l, --lock-file=NAME

    Customize the name of the lock file. By default this is the base name of
    the external command, so if you're running something generic like `bash'
    or `python' you might want to change this :-).

  -v, --verbose

    Increase logging verbosity (can be repeated).

  -q, --quiet

    Decrease logging verbosity (can be repeated).

  -h, --help

    Show this message and exit.
