"""
Portable process control functionality for the `executor` package.

The :mod:`executor.process` module defines the :class:`ControllableProcess`
abstract base class which enables process control features like waiting for a
process to end, gracefully terminating it and forcefully killing it. The
process control functionality in :class:`ControllableProcess` is separated from
the command execution functionality in :class:`~executor.ExternalCommand` to
make it possible to re-use the process control functionality in other Python
packages, see for example the :class:`proc.core.Process` class.

    Abstract, portable process control functionality.

    By defining a subclass of :class:`ControllableProcess` and implementing the
    :attr:`pid`, :attr:`command_line` and :attr:`is_running` properties and the
    :func:`terminate_helper()` and :func:`kill_helper()` methods you get the
    :func:`wait_for_process()`, :func:`terminate()` and :func:`kill()` methods
    for free. This decoupling has enabled me to share a lot of code between two
    Python projects of mine with similar goals but very different
    requirements:

    1. The `executor` package builds on top of the :mod:`subprocess` module
       in the Python standard library and strives to be as cross platform
       as possible. This means things like UNIX signals are not an option
       (although signals exist on Windows they are hardly usable). The package
       mostly deals with :class:`subprocess.Popen` objects internally (to hide
       platform specific details as much as possible).

    2. The proc_ package exposes process information available in the Linux
       process information pseudo-file system available at ``/proc``. The
       package mostly deals with process IDs internally. Because this is
       completely specialized to a UNIX environment the use of things
       like UNIX signals is not a problem at all.

           for it to terminate gracefully or `timeout` seconds have passed
           (whichever comes first).

           `timeout` seconds have passed, it will be forcefully terminated
           using :func:`kill()` (the value of `timeout` that was given to
