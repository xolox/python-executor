Dependency injection for command execution contexts.

The :mod:`~executor.contexts` module defines the :class:`LocalContext`,
:class:`RemoteContext` and :class:`SecureChangeRootContext` classes. All of
these classes support the same API for executing external commands, they are
simple wrappers for :class:`.ExternalCommand`, :class:`.RemoteCommand` and
:class:`.SecureChangeRootCommand`.

This allows you to script interaction with external commands in Python and
perform that interaction on your local system, on remote systems over SSH_ or
inside chroots_ using the exact same Python code. `Dependency injection`_ on
steroids anyone? :-)

Here's a simple example:

.. code-block:: python

   from executor.contexts import LocalContext, RemoteContext
   from humanfriendly import format_timespan

   def details_about_system(context):
       return "\n".join([
           "Information about %s:" % context,
           " - Host name: %s" % context.capture('hostname', '--fqdn'),
           " - Uptime: %s" % format_timespan(float(context.capture('cat', '/proc/uptime').split()[0])),
       ])

   print(details_about_system(LocalContext()))

   # Information about local system (peter-macbook):
   #  - Host name: peter-macbook
   #  - Uptime: 1 week, 3 days and 10 hours

   print(details_about_system(RemoteContext('file-server')))

   # Information about remote system (file-server):
   #  - Host name: file-server
   #  - Uptime: 18 weeks, 3 days and 4 hours

Whether this functionality looks exciting or horrible I'll leave up to your
judgment. I created it because I'm always building "tools that help me build
tools" and this functionality enables me to *very rapidly* prototype system
integration tools developed using Python:

**During development:**
 I *write* code on my workstation which I prefer because of the "rich editing
 environment" but I *run* the code against a remote system over SSH (a backup
 server, database server, hypervisor, mail server, etc.).

**In production:**
 I change one line of code to inject a :class:`LocalContext` object instead of
 a :class:`RemoteContext` object, I install the `executor` package and the code
 I wrote on the remote system and I'm done!

    def apt_sources_info(self):
        """
        A tuple with two strings (the distributor ID and distribution codename).

        The values of the :attr:`distributor_id` and :attr:`distribution_codename`
        properties are determined by one of the following three methods (in
        decreasing order of preference):

        1. If :attr:`lsb_release_variables` is available it's used.
        2. If the :man:`lsb_release` program is available it's used.
        3. Finally ``/etc/apt/sources.list`` is parsed for hints.

        The :attr:`apt_sources_info` property concerns the third step which
        works as follows:

        - The ``deb`` directives in ``/etc/apt/sources.list`` are parsed to
          determine the primary package mirror URL (it's fine if this file
          doesn't exist, no error will be reported).

        - The :data:`MIRROR_TO_DISTRIB_MAPPING` dictionary is used to look up
          the distributor ID corresponding to the package mirror URL that was
          found in ``/etc/apt/sources.list``.

        - If the mirror URL is successfully translated to a distributor ID, the
          third token in the ``deb`` directive is taken to be the distribution
          codename.

        The :attr:`apt_sources_info` property was added in response to `issue
        #17`_ where it was reported that official Debian Docker images don't
        contain the ``/etc/lsb-release`` file nor the :man:`lsb_release`
        program.

        This is only used as a last resort because of its specificness to
        Debian based Linux distributions and because I have concerns about how
        robust this new functionality will turn out to be.

        - This method *emulates* filename globbing as supported by system
          shells like Bash and ZSH. It works by forking a Python interpreter
          and using that to call the :func:`glob.glob()` function. This
          approach is of course rather heavyweight.

        - Initially this method used Bash for filename matching (similar to
          `this StackOverflow answer <https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/34012/44309>`_)
          but I found it impossible to make this work well for patterns
          containing whitespace.

        - I took the whitespace issue as a sign that I was heading down the
          wrong path (trying to add robustness to a fragile solution) and so
          the new implementation was born (which prioritizes robustness over
          performance).
