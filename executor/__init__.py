"""
Core functionality of the `executor` package.

If you're looking for an easy way to run external commands from Python take a
look at the :func:`execute()` function. When you need more flexibility consider
using the underlying :class:`ExternalCommand` class directly instead.

:func:`execute()` versus :class:`ExternalCommand`
-------------------------------------------------

In :mod:`executor` 1.x the :func:`execute()` function was the only interface
for external command execution. This had several drawbacks:

- The documentation for the :func:`execute()` function was getting way too
  complex given all of the supported options and combinations.

- There was no way to execute asynchronous external commands (running in the
  background) without sidestepping the complete :mod:`executor` module and
  going straight for :class:`subprocess.Popen` (with all of the verbosity
  that you get for free with :mod:`subprocess` :-).

- There was no way to prepare an external command without starting it
  immediately, making it impossible to prepare a batch of external commands
  before starting them (whether synchronously or asynchronously).

To solve these problems :mod:`executor` 2.x introduced the
:class:`ExternalCommand` class. This explains why :func:`execute()` is now a
trivial wrapper around :class:`ExternalCommand`: It's main purpose is to be an
easy to use shortcut that preserves compatibility with the old interface.

DEFAULT_SHELL = 'bash'

The default shell used to evaluate shell expressions (a string).

This variable isn't based on the ``$SHELL`` environment variable because:

1. Shells like ``sh``, ``dash``, ``bash`` and ``zsh`` all have their own
   subtly incompatible semantics.
2. People regularly use shells like ``fish`` as their default login shell :-).

At an interactive prompt this is no problem (advanced users have obviously
learned to context switch) but when you're writing source code the last thing
you want to worry about is which shell is going to evaluate your commands! The
:mod:`executor` package expects this shell to support the following features:

- The ``-c`` option to evaluate a shell command provided as a command line
  argument.

- The ``-`` argument to instruct the shell to read shell commands from its
  standard input stream and evaluate those.

Apart from these two things nothing else is expected from the default shell so
you're free to customize it if you really want to write your shell commands in
``fish`` or ``zsh`` syntax :-).

def execute(*command, **options):

    Execute an external command and make sure it succeeded.

    :param command: All positional arguments are passed on to the constructor
                    of :class:`ExternalCommand`.
    :param options: All keyword arguments are passed on to the constructor of
                    :class:`ExternalCommand`.
    :returns: Refer to :func:`execute_prepared()`.
    :raises: :exc:`ExternalCommandFailed` when the command exits with a
             nonzero exit code (and :attr:`~ExternalCommand.check` is
             :data:`True`).

    If :attr:`~ExternalCommand.asynchronous` is :data:`True` then :func:`execute()`
    will automatically start the external command for you using
    :func:`~ExternalCommand.start()` (but it won't wait for it to end). If you
    want to create an :class:`ExternalCommand` object instance without
    immediately starting the external command then you can use
    :class:`ExternalCommand` directly.

    **Some examples**

    By default the status code of the external command is returned as a boolean:

    >>> from executor import execute
    >>> execute('true')
    True

    However when an external command exits with a nonzero status code an
    exception is raised, this is intended to "make it easy to do the right
    thing" (never forget to check the status code of an external command
    without having to write a lot of repetitive code):

    >>> execute('false')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "executor/__init__.py", line 124, in execute
        cmd.start()
      File "executor/__init__.py", line 516, in start

        raise ExternalCommandFailed(self)
    executor.ExternalCommandFailed: External command failed with exit code 1! (command: false)

    What's also useful to know is that exceptions raised by :func:`execute()`
    expose :attr:`~ExternalCommandFailed.command` and
    :attr:`~ExternalCommandFailed.returncode` attributes. If you know a command
    is likely to exit with a nonzero status code and you want :func:`execute()`
    to simply return a boolean you can do this instead:

    >>> execute('false', check=False)
    False

class ExternalCommand(ControllableProcess):

    """
    Programmer friendly :class:`subprocess.Popen` wrapper.

    The :class:`ExternalCommand` class wraps :class:`subprocess.Popen` to make
    it easier to do the right thing (the simplicity of :func:`os.system()` with
    the robustness of :class:`subprocess.Popen`) and to provide additional
    features (e.g. asynchronous command execution that preserves the ability to
    provide input and capture output).

    **Process manipulation**
     :class:`ExternalCommand` inherits from :class:`~executor.process.ControllableProcess`
     which means that all of the process manipulation supported by
     :class:`~executor.process.ControllableProcess` is also supported by
     :class:`ExternalCommand` objects.

    **Context manager**
      :class:`ExternalCommand` objects can be used as context managers by using
      the :keyword:`with` statement:

      - When the scope of the :keyword:`with` statement starts the
        :func:`start()` method is called (if the external command
        isn't already running).
      - When the scope of the :keyword:`with` statement ends
        :func:`~executor.process.ControllableProcess.terminate()` is called if
        the command is still running. The :func:`load_output()` and
        :func:`cleanup()` functions are used to cleanup after the external
        command. If an exception isn't already being raised
        :func:`check_errors()` is called to make sure the external command
        succeeded.

    .. _event callbacks:

    **Event callbacks**
        The :attr:`start_event`, :attr:`retry_event` and :attr:`finish_event`
        properties can be set to callbacks (callable values like functions) to
        subscribe to the corresponding events. The callback receives a single
        positional argument which is the :class:`ExternalCommand` object.

        The :attr:`start_event` and :attr:`finish_event` properties were
        originally created for use in command pools, for example to report to
        the operator when specific commands are started and when they finish.
        The event handling is performed inside the :class:`ExternalCommand`
        class though, so you're free to repurpose these events outside the
        context of command pools.

        When the :attr:`silent` option was originally added to executor it was
        implemented by redirecting the output streams to :data:`os.devnull`,
        similar to how ``command &> /dev/null`` works in Bash.

        Since I made that decision I've regretted it many times because I ran
        into situations where :attr:`check` and :attr:`silent` were both set
        and :exc:`ExternalCommandFailed` was raised but I had no way to
        determine what had gone wrong.

        This is why the :attr:`really_silent` property was introduced in
        executor release 19.0:

        - When :attr:`silent` is :data:`True` and :attr:`check` is
          :data:`False` the value of :attr:`really_silent` will be
          :data:`True`, otherwise it is :data:`False`.

        - When :attr:`really_silent` is :data:`False` (because :attr:`check` is
          :data:`True`) the :attr:`silent` property effectively becomes an
          alias for :attr:`capture` and :attr:`capture_stderr` which means the
          output on both streams is captured instead of discarded.

        - Because output is captured instead of discarded the output of
          failing commands can be reported by :exc:`ExternalCommandFailed`
          (which is raised because :attr:`check` is :data:`True`).

        This change was made after much consideration because it is backwards
        incompatible and not only in a theoretical sense: Imagine a daemon
        process spewing megabytes of log output on its standard error stream.

        As an escape hatch to restore backwards compatibility you can set
        :attr:`really_silent` to :data:`True` to override the computed value.

          any lines until the hidden read-ahead buffer is full. This makes
