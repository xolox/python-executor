"""
Remote command execution using SSH.

The :mod:`executor.ssh.client` module defines the :class:`RemoteCommand` class
and the :func:`foreach()` function which make it easy to run a remote command
in parallel on multiple remote hosts using SSH.

The :func:`foreach()` function also serves as a simple example of how to use
:class:`~executor.concurrent.CommandPool` and :class:`RemoteCommand` objects
(it's just 16 lines of code if you squint in the right way and that includes
logging :-).

The :class:`SecureTunnel` class makes it easy to use "tunnel only"
SSH connections by waiting until the tunnel becomes connected and
automatically selecting a free ephemeral port number if a
local port number isn't provided by the caller.

               (not the default) and an SSH connection was successful but the
               remote command failed (the exit code of the ``ssh`` command was
               neither zero nor 255). Use the keyword argument ``check=False``
               to disable raising of this exception.

    .. note:: The :func:`foreach()` function enables the :attr:`.check` and
              :attr:`.delay_checks` options by default in an attempt to make it
              easy to do "the right thing". My assumption here is that if you
              are running *the same command* on multiple remote hosts:

              - You definitely want to know when a remote command has failed,
                ideally without manually checking the :attr:`.succeeded`
                property of each command.

              - Regardless of whether some remote commands fail you want to
                know that the command was at least executed on all hosts,
                otherwise your cluster of hosts will end up in a very
                inconsistent state.

              - If remote commands fail and an exception is raised the
                exception message should explain *which* remote commands
                failed.

              If these assumptions are incorrect then you can use the keyword
              arguments ``check=False`` and/or ``delay_checks=False`` to opt
              out of "doing the right thing" ;-)

          connections to new hosts are frequently made. This option forces the
          user to manually add all new hosts. If this flag is set to "no", ssh
          will automatically add new host keys to the user known hosts files.
          If this flag is set to "ask", new host keys will be added to the user
          known host files only after the user has confirmed that is what they
          really want to do, and ssh will refuse to connect to hosts whose host
          key has changed. The host keys of known hosts will be verified
