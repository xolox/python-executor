"""
Simple command execution in chroot environments.

The :mod:`executor.chroot` module defines the :class:`ChangeRootCommand` class
which makes it easy to run commands inside chroots_. If this doesn't mean
anything to you, here's a primer:

- The word 'chroot' is an abbreviation of the phrase 'change root' which is
  Unix functionality that changes the 'root' directory (``/``) of a running
  process, so 'change root' describes an action.

- Even though the phrase 'change root' describes an action the word 'chroot'
  is also used to refer to the directory which serves as the new root directory
  (English is flexible like that :-). This is why it makes sense to say that
  "you're entering the chroot".

.. warning:: This is low level functionality. This module performs absolutely
             no chroot initialization, for example ``/etc/resolv.conf`` may be
             incorrect and there won't be any bind mounts available in the
             chroot (unless you've prepared them yourself).

If you need your chroot to be initialized for you then consider using the
:mod:`executor.schroot` module instead. It takes a bit of time to set up
schroot_ but it provides a more high level experience than chroot_.
